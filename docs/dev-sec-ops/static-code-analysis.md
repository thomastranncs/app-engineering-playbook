# Static Code Analysis

Static code analysis is a critical practice for identifying bugs, vulnerabilities, and code quality issues early in the development lifecycle before code is deployed.

## Why Static Code Analysis?
- Detects security vulnerabilities, code smells, and bugs automatically.
- Enforces coding standards and best practices.
- Improves maintainability and reliability of codebases.
- Reduces technical debt and review effort.

## Recommended Tools

### SonarCloud (Cloud-Based)
- SaaS solution for static code analysis.
- Integrates with GitHub, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, and more.
- Provides dashboards, pull request decoration, and quality gates.
- Recommended for public or cloud-hosted projects.
- [SonarCloud Documentation](https://sonarcloud.io/documentation)

### SonarQube Community Edition (On-Premises)
- Free, open-source version of SonarQube for on-premises deployment.
- Suitable for private networks and regulated environments.
- Can be deployed within your organization's infrastructure for full control.
- Integrates with CI/CD pipelines and supports multiple languages.
- [SonarQube Community Edition Docs](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/)

### IDE Plugins
- SonarLint: Real-time feedback in IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.).
- Helps developers catch issues before code is committed.
- [SonarLint Documentation](https://www.sonarlint.org/)

## Best Practices
- Integrate static analysis into CI pipelines to block merging code with critical issues.
- Use quality gates to enforce minimum standards (e.g., no new critical bugs or vulnerabilities).
- Run analysis on all pull requests and main branches.
- Use IDE plugins for immediate feedback during development.
- Regularly review and address issues flagged by the tools.
