# Code Reviews

## Introduction

Code review is a collaborative process where someone other than the author examines code changes before they are merged into a shared branch. The primary goals are to improve code quality, share knowledge, and maintain a healthy, maintainable codebase.

### Why Do Code Reviews?

- **Improve Code Quality:** Code reviews help identify and remove defects, enforce standards, and ensure best practices are followed before code is integrated.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Reviewing code exposes team members to new patterns, technologies, and parts of the codebase, helping everyone learn and grow.
- **Shared Understanding:** Code reviews foster a shared understanding of the system and encourage collective ownership of the code.

### What to Look For in a Code Review

- **Design:** Is the code well-designed and appropriate for the system?
- **Functionality:** Does the code behave as intended and meet requirements?
- **Simplicity:** Can the code be made simpler or more readable?
- **Testing:** Are there sufficient and effective automated tests?
- **Naming:** Are variable, class, and method names clear and meaningful?
- **Comments:** Are comments clear, necessary, and helpful?
- **Style:** Does the code follow the team's style guide?
- **Documentation:** Is relevant documentation updated as needed?

### Best Practices

- Review every pull request or change before merging.
- Choose reviewers who are familiar with the code or domain.
- Provide constructive, actionable feedback.
- Keep reviews timely and respectful.
- Use code review tools to streamline the process.
